								<h2>Hometown</h2>
								<p>I am from the small city of Butler, Pennsylvania, about 35 minutes north of Pittsburgh. Butler is an old town, most notably known for the creation of the Jeep.
								During World War II, the United States government contacted 135 companies requesting blueprints for an all-terrain vehicle. The trick was, the government wanted a working prototype withing 49 days.
								American Bantam Car was the only company to accept the challenge, and they completed the first Jeep in roughly two months. From that point on, it is estimated that 363,000 Jeeps were produced in Butler for World War II.</p>
								<h2>Family</h2>
								<p>I am the older brother of my sister, Marisa. She is a senior in high school and in the "college frenzy" stage. My mother, Lynn, and father, Michael, are the two best parents any kid could lucky to have.
								They have been married for 25 years and are the best role models.</p>
								<h2>Sports</h2>
								<p>Sports have defined my life and my family's life forever. My dad played sports as a child and continued on to become my best coach and biggest fan. Marisa has been involved
								in a multitude of sports. She loves horseback riding and has been riding for almost 7 years. I played soccer as a young kid 
								because my parents wanted me to get exercise. I started playing baseball when I was 6 and I've played ever since. During the winter months, I played basketball to stay busy.</p>
								<h2>Academics</h2>
								<p>School has always been the top priority. My parents always said sports will eventually end but an education won't. So, I always took school seriously and took a liking to math. Knowing that math was my favorite subject
								and sports were a huge part of my life, I wanted to pursue an education where I could combine the two. That is how I decided on statistics, with the original idea that I could work in the front office of a professional sports organization.</p>
