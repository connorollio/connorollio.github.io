								<h2>INLS 161</h2>
								<p>Tools for Information Literacy is helping me better understand the processes of a computer. It includes using different softwares and maintaining them, working with differenct applications such as the Microsoft Office family of apps, and
								understanding how servers and networks function. Some of the tasks in the class include connecting to a server, creating a website, dealing with markup in Microsoft Word, and more. INLS 161 holds class on Thursday mornings from 8:00am - 9:15am 
								along with a recitation session on Tuesdays from 8:00am - 9:15am.</p>

								<h2>STOR 455</h2>
								<p>From 9:45am - 11:00am on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I attend STOR 455 - Stochastic Modeling. It is a statistics class that teaches me different processes to make future predictions. For example, right now we are learning how to calculate different 
								probabilities that a machine functions for a certain amount of time. It is a conceptually challenging class but the real-life application of material will certainly pay off in life after schooling.</p>

								<h2>EXSS 327</h2>
								<p>Predictive Analytics in Sports is a hands-on class that closely represents the sports analytics occupation. The statistical concepts we are learning are rather simple statistics that one may learn in an entry-level statistics course. The seperating factor 
								for EXSS 327 is the semester-long group project. Each group is to devise a research question in the realm of sports. The question is supposed to help explain the importance across a season, a tournament, or even a draft selection. For instance, a project may 
								look at the effect points scored by bench players has on success in the NCAA Basketball Tournament. I spend a lot of time outside of class meeting with my fellow group members, but the class meets as a whole on Mondays and Wednesdays from 8:45am - 10:00am.</p>

								<h2>STOR 471</h2>
								<p>Long Term Actuarial Models is another challening statistics course. It is an upper-level class specifically designed to prepare you for the LTAM Actuary Exam. LTAM stands for "Long Term Actuary Mathematics", so it truly is taught directly for the test. 
								It is challenging because it is a lot of memorization of comlex equations. These equations include life expectancy, amortized loans, and many others surrounding life insurance. STOR 471 meets virtually from 5:45pm - 7:45pm on Monday and Wednesday nights.</p>

								<h2>PWAD 238</h2>
								<p>The American Revolution is literally the origin story of the United States of America. I believe it is important to understand those origins which is why I enrolled in the electice PWAD 238. In class, we are taking a deeper dive into the behind-the-scenes events 
								of the Revolutionary Era. For example, we have already read two books. The first book was about the Boston Massacre, excpet through the perspective of the British Army. The second novel was a journeyman story about a New England woman escaping to the Continental Army. 
								All in all, the class strays from the battles and the war which makes it very interesting about our country's history. PWAD 238 occurs from 12:00pm - 12:50pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p>
